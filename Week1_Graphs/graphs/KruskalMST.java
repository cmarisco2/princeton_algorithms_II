 * Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Class
 *
 * Processing Paradigm for the Undirected Edge-Weighted Graph Class:
 *
 * Utilizes Greedy MST Algorithm to find a Tree, T that is minimum spanning.
 * -It is the minimum weight
 * -It is a tree, T (connected and acyclic).
 * -It spans every vertex in given Graph, G.
